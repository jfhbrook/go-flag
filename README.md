# go-flag

This is an ongoing attempt to port [go's flag package](https://pkg.go.dev/flag)
to Python.

## Status

Enough tests are in place that I'm confident in calling this code complete - or
at least complete enough to start using it and backfill tests as I break
things.

I still need to clean up docstrings and publish, but otherwise this is looking
pretty good!
