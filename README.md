# go-flag

This is an ongoing attempt to port [go's flag package](https://pkg.go.dev/flag)
to Python.

## Status

The general shape of [the package](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/flag/flag_test.go)
is in place, but crucial methods are unimplemented. I'll be implementing them
as I port [the tests](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/flag/flag_test.go).
